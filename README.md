# Tab Stats
[Tab Stats](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tab-stats) is a mod that will show you all player's stats that have ever played on the server.   

This includes
 - Last seen
 - Time played
 - Kills
 - Deaths
 - Death/hour   
 
It also works in single player.

The inspiration for the mod has come from multiple places but most notable [FTB Utilities (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-utilities-forge) where it was possible to see when a player was last online and all of the other stats.

As I in [Server Tab Info](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/server-tab-info) found out that the vanilla scoreboard is displayed on the player list, I began thinking about what stats to display and if it could be done like the player list.
This has colminated in this mod.
